# Customer Relationship Management Desktop App

CRM Desktop app is intended for a smaller company that cooperates with other companies. The company's employees have a unified view of all the companies they do business with, as well as the employees of the companies with whom they are expected to communicate. They have the ability to list, add, filter contacts, send emails to contacts. In addition, employees can assign their colleagues which clients they should contact, by when and in what way (call, email, meeting).
